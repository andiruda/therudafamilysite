<h1>June 2014 Update</h1>
<p>Hey everyone!!! Thank you to everyone who has been praying and supporting us, without your generous giving and encouragement we would not be able to do what we are doing, so thank you so much!</p>
<p>I have a few updates to share.  Rachel and I have moved out of our tiny home, temporarily, while I redo that back wall.  We had a window Air Conditioner that was leaking water into the wall from the window frame and down.  It had been leaking for over 2 months.  We first noticed that we were getting some of the same symptoms that we had been fighting this last 2 years, thats when we noticed the water behind the couch, under the window.  I started pulling off the molding and found some mold.  I then pulled off the wall down to the studs, just under the window, and tossed out all the water soaked and mold stained items.  I then pulled out the insulation in the sub-floor on that edge of the house (it was soaking wet) and sprayed a mold killer on everything.  I will be putting everything back together after it has dried out and new material is purchased.  The base here has a lot of housing and has put us into one of their Mission Builder Cabins.  The boys are loving the room to run around inside.</p>
<p>Rachel is getting ready to staff the School of worship.  The school will start this coming February, please be praying for more students and staff to fill out the school.  She continues to work in housekeeping, and lunch cleanup for the base.</p>
<p>Andi is continuing his IT work.  The base was recently donated 20 nice computers.  He has been updating computers around the base with these.</p>
