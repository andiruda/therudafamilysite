	<h4>A HISTORY IN BRIEF</h4>
	<p>The Ruda family is fully convinced that God has an amazing plan out there for us and for all of you! His plan is so intricate in detail and so broad reaching in design, that no circumstance you currently find your self in is outside of it’s scope. God is Good to us!</p>
	<p>To summarize: 2 Years ago, Rachel and I prayed the Lord would wake us up and bring us out of complacency.  Since then, we have lost everything material and yet strangely enough…gained everything else.  For everyone that isn’t aware of our recent circumstances I will give a brief account.  2 years ago My wife and I purchased a beautiful 2 story home in downtown Salem, OR.  It was an older 1945 home with a full, unfinished basement.  Unknown to us at the time, the house had some unknown and to this day undiagnosed drainage issue that cause the basement to remain constantly damp.  We enjoyed our recently remodeled home for the first half of the year in relative comfort.  Rachel had begun to show signs of sickness before the rest of us, and as we would later find out, had carried a lot of stuff back with her from Ukraine, before we had met.  We didn’t think much of the myriad of Rachel’s ailments however, seeing as how she had just given birth to our second son, which inherently carries with it an array of symptoms.  A year to the date after we had moved in, I (Andi) found myself at the Dr’s office getting an MRI for my severe vertigo.  What we didn’t know but soon found out, shortly before we evacuated our home after living there for only 1.5 years, our home was infested with Chaetomium, a common household mold.  Chaetomium, in certain circumstances, can give off a metabolite that is extremely toxic to humans, tricothecene.  The mold growing in our house was giving this neurotoxin off in abundance. After inhaling that for about a year and a half we found ourselves in the ER with peripheral nervous system dysfunctions.  From there we lost everything.  We lost our clothes, our home, our health.  We even lost our car to mold after we had moved out and were too sick to drive it for a couple weeks, it was taken over by a white downy growth of mold.  The insurance company came out and totaled it and towed it away.  We found ourselves homeless and without a car.  My (Andi) parents opened up their home to us and lent us their car for that time.  My (Andi) work also let me work from home, which they continued and to this day still allow.  As tough as this time was, we were blessed in so many ways, some of which were: monetary gifts arriving in the mail at the perfect time, donations of clothing we received from family and friends, one of the hospital bills being written off, Rachel’s mothers car that was loaned to us, the tiny house on a trailer we stumbled onto when looking for a home, and even the truck that we got for cheap that would tow it.  In summation, we lost our home to mold, and through the transition the word that the Lord spoke to me (Andi) has proved to be truly prophetic.</p>  
	<p><em>“If you turn to me and seek me I will, restore your family to health, give you a home, and release you into ministry”</em></p>
	<p>In a few short months we began the road to healing, we moved into our tiny home on a trailer and God led us to live in an RV Park in Bend OR where the climate is very dry and the high elevation makes it harder for mold to grow.</p>
	<h4>...AND OFF TO BEND WE GO</h4>
	<p>So there we were, living in Bend, OR, Andi was working remotely for the same company out of Portland, and Rachel and the boys were recovering from their physical maladies.  We maintained this routine for a total of 5 months before we were faced with a difficult decision.  The spot we were renting was tripling in price and we were unable to live there past another month.  We prayed about what we were suppose to do for the next step and God spoke the following word to us,</p>
	<p><em>“Go towards worship  and bible studies”</em></p>
	<p>While I (Rachel) was a bit skeptical, Andi felt very strongly that Ywam Chico was our next step.  So we prayed about it and put some fleeces out and gradually both of us began to get really excited about the possibility.  So, Andi wrote the YWAM base, (the same base that we had met at 6 years prior) and things just started making sense. They accepted our application for Mission Builders (a short term all around volunteer), and we started packing.  We arrived and immediately saw the Hand of God in our circumstances.  The base had placed our tiny home right next to the playground and sandpit, which would prove to be invaluable to Andi, as he was to watch both boys while continuing to work from home for the same company.  I (Rachel) started my work duties in the house keeping department almost immediately.  We are so thankful for the amazing people at this base that welcomed us so quickly into their lives and continue to speak life into us. They have been aware of what we have gone through and yet are believing with us that God has so much in store for us. We have already been welcomed over to dinners and bible studies and birthday parties, Andi has played the drums twice now for worship and were even able to go on two dates already because of this sweet community of believers that whole-heartedly support families!</p>
	<h4>SO HERE WE ARE</h4>
	<p><img src="images/Newsletter-picture-2-edit.jpg" style="float:right;" />Going through all of this has really opened our eyes to how fragile and short life can be. As much as we want to be responsible with our health and mindful of that, we don’t want to waste any of the time God has planned on giving us. So,because this last season has caused us to be more intentional with our time, we have been praying about moving into full time staff from our current position as mission builders.  We know that God was not the one who gave us the mold and now realize that the battle for peoples minds and hearts really is much bigger than we ever felt before. Therefore, we would like to be apart of God healing people in a bigger way than we ever have too.  As full time staff, we would be able to commit more time and resources to the ministry that God is doing at this base.  In particular, they are starting up a School of Worship (S.O.W.) here in the fall.  The base will be pioneering the S.O.W. here and are in sore need of people with knowledge or experience with this specific YWAM coarse.  It just so happens that Rachel completed a School of Worship through the University of Nations in Kona, HI during her previous time in YWAM.  God has put it on both our hearts that Rachel is to staff this school.  So without knowing exactly how the specifics are going to work out, we have committed to put Rachel into a staff position for this school. This will be a leap of faith while we raise the support and figure out what my (Andi) role will be and how our 2 boys will get to join into all of this.  So far, I (Andi) have become the go-to guy for internet problems and cell phone service and solar issues as well. We are praying for a preschool option for Isaac to open up in the fall.  We’re super excited for all the possibilities and opportunities to serve here at this base, there is so much potential to further the kingdom of God here.</p>
	<h4>IN CONCLUSION</h4>
	<p>Thank you so much to everyone who has sent their love to us though so many various ways. We are deeply blessed to have such amazing friends and family.  We are currently getting everything setup to move into full time missions.  Please pray for us as we move into this new phase. If you are interested in partnering with us financially please contact us, we hope to have that tax deductible soon.  We are going to be needing monthly support to continue as well as any one time gifts to finish paying off our medical bills.  To contact us please email:</p>
