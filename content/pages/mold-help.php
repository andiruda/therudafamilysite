	In 2013 we evacuated our beautifully remodeled 75yr old home.  We left everything (cars, clothes, jewelry, etc..) to start life over mold free, if indeed we were going to live, which at the time we didn't think so.  Toxic black mold made our family real sick.  We had only been exposed to the neurotoxin that the specific mold growing in our basement was producing for a 1 1/2 years, but that was enough to poison our nervous system, cause developmental delays, and destroy our healthy immune systems.  Through this rough journey, we have learned a lot of thing about health and wellness as well as detoxification and mycotoxins. We decided we wanted to help others that are going through the same issues as we went through.

	That is what this section of our site is dedicated to.  If you have made it to our site, and you are dealing with Toxic Mold sickness, please know there is hope.  Even if you have too much brain fog to think, or if you have so much fatigue that you can't even get out of bed, you have options!  You CAN fight this!!  One of the greatest tools in your belt is knowledge!  We hope to provide you with enough of this to guide you to your own recovery story.  There are a number of people out there getting sick with illnesses that can be traced back to toxigenic mold metabolites, and a few solid ideas as to why these are on the rise.
