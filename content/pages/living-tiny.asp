<p>
	For the past year we have been living in a tiny 144sqft house on a trailer.  We LOVE it!  It is a little cramped with all for of us, but while the boys are young, we are able to pull it off. We have learned so much about living in such a tiny space.

<p>
	We are selling our tiny home!  We are moving into a new season in life, we were able to move into a 3 bedroom house here at YWAM Chico, and feel God's provision in the move.  We are moving towards being fully supported and one of those steps is to sell our tiny ome to pay off the remainder of our debts.  If you are interested please check out our <a href="http://chico.craigslist.org/rvs/4683920244.html" target="_blank">Craig's List Ad</a><br /><br />
	I have posted pictures on this page of the interior and some exterior.  We have loved this tiny home but are excited for this new season.
