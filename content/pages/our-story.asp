<h4>November 26th 2013</h4>
<p>This last year has been a long hard road for us.  From not knowing what was going on, to knowing what was going on and not how to fix it, to finally knowing what we must do and then doing it.  We have received gifts, help, comfort, and support from you all.  Thank You SO MUCH!  We could not be where we are right now without your kindness, concern, and generosity.  Rachel and I have been touched very deep and completely humbled by the overwhelming response of love and compassion from everyone that has reached out to us during this difficult transition.  I hope that you will allow me to catch you up on the events that have pushed us into this situation and bring you current on our health and wellbeing.  I also hope that you will understand when I say, Thank You.</p>
<p>Although we didn’t know it, our trouble started over a year ago, the end of Spring 2012, when Rachel and I excitedly purchased our first home.  We closed and moved in, in less then a month, with our eldest son, Isaac, who had just turned 2, and our youngest, Amadeu, who was only a few months old.  After one week in the house our sewer backed up.  Our house was a 1945 fully remodeled home with a full “unfinished” basement.  Half the basement was framed in with sheet rock, the other half still was just the concrete wall.  In the corner of the basement was a drain that tied into the main drainage pipe out of the house.  This drain is supposed to help unwanted water drain out of the basement.  In our situation, when the main drain plugged, this floor drain in the basement was the lowest point of the system and became the hole through which sewage flooded the corner of our basement with.   We immediately called our home warranty plan, and were informed that they would send someone out the next day.  After they came out and unplugged it for us, they told us that this frequently happens to homes that have been sitting for  while.  Over the next year as it backed up almost monthly, I learned that our situation was different.  Some time that year we paid for a plumber to come out and put a camera down the pipe to see why it kept backing up.  They found nothing conclusive, and after unplugging it again for us, they told us that it was simply a plug that was never fully “unplugged”.  One thing I did learn from this expensive explanation was the layout of our plumbing.  We had only about 25 feet of piping under the house, and it was in such a way that it was a straight shot to the street.  I also learned that there are other pipes that “feed” into this main pipe that are no longer in use.  We had a very straightforward and simple setup.  Something unexplained was causing our sewage to frequently plug up.</p>
<p>February of that winter was when we I first experienced the symptoms that I would fight with for the next 10 months.  Looking back we realize now that Isaac, Amadeu, and Rachel were all fighting symptoms of exposure as far back as the first few months after we moved in.   Isaac had already developed a funny sounding cough that seemed to stick around, and the rash on his cheeks, that he has had since an allergic reaction to penicillin when he was one got pronouncedly worse.  Rachel struggled with substantial changes in her emotions and mood as well as the more physical maladies of insomnia, rashes, and flu like symptoms.  When I first noticed anything, I had just overcome a cold and was still feeling pretty fatigued.  We were on a date when it happened.  I had taken Rachel to the park an we were walking along a path when suddenly I walked in to her.  It was the weirdest feeling, just uncontrollably having your world tilted and you walk completely sideways.  I went another couple weeks without an incident.  Then one day driving home from work I had one of my worst episodes.  At the time I was working an hours drive, on a main highway, from my house, and I had noticed minor symptoms popping up here and there, but didn’t know what they meant.  When I was driving in the car and began to pass out at the wheel, I knew something was up.  I almost lost control a few times before I made it to an exit and had Rachel and the boys come and pick me up.  I know now that my central nervous system was shutting down my muscles in my body and I was on the verge of loosing consciousness.  That episode sparked a search for an answer.  I went through the usual rounds of testing.  My doctor ruled out a lot of things, and couldn’t find an answer to my vertigo and other symptoms.  He finally scheduled me for a CT scan, that my insurance wouldn’t cover.  The CT scan gave no new information however, and left a rather large bill in its wake.</p>
<p>So fast forward to Summer 2013, still all of us sick with random symptoms, and no answers to any questions, I was down in the basement unplugging our drain with a rented router machine for the twelfth time when I noticed some black spots on the wall next to me.  I pulled the sheet rock off and found black mold all over the sheet rock.  I should have taken my family, and immediately evacuated our house until the extent of the issue was known, but at the time I had no clue how toxic it was, neither did I connect the dots of our ongoing health issues with it.  I had seen mold before and never had it made me this sick.  It wasn’t until the next month, when all our symptoms seemed to be flourishing and we seemed to be dying that my Mom suggested something to me that Rachel had asked me about almost a year prior.  They had both asked me if mold was causing this.  A year prior with Rachel however the question was more about the effects of mold we had found under a mattress in the basement, which I should have looked into then.  When my mom intoned this question again, I told her the same thing, that it couldn’t be.  Turns out I was wrong twice.  Rachel and I did some research into it and discovered all of our symptoms listed out, plus a few that we thankfully didn’t have yet.  We found out that we were stage 2 of 3, and that our boys had most stage 1 symptoms with a couple stage 2.  This lead into our worst week, a culmination of pain, confusion, and chaos.</p>
<p>Two of the symptoms of mold sickness are a feeling of hopelessness, and depression.  Once we realized what we might possibly be dealing with, that our home was making us sick, we broke down.  Where could be go, what could we do?  I left for work knowing that my wife and children were possibly being poisoned the whole time I was gone, by simply breathing in the air in our house.  I came home early that final day of that terrible week after an urgent call with Rachel.  We needed to do something and fast.  We were slipping physically, our minds weren’t remembering things, we were literally loosing short term memory.  We continually had “brain fog” that prevented us from making choices that should have been clear and easy to make.  We came to the conclusion that we needed to get out of there, and fast.  My parents offered to let us stay at their place, and they lived only thirty minutes away from us, so we packed up everything we could in an hour and headed out of there hoping to return once the mold was gone.</p>
<p>This is when we got a professional company to come in and tell us what kind of mold we had, and to clean it up for us.  We found out our basement was infested with Chaetomium, one of the “Toxic Black Molds”, which is poorly named, due to it’s white downy color.  Chaetomium gives off a toxin that attaches to it spores, this toxin is a very effective neurotoxin.  As with any bio-toxin it destroys your immune system and opens your body up for disease and infections. The mold releases the it’s spores into the air, which are then breathed in, or ingested with other foods that have been exposed to the contaminated air.  Once in your system they wreak havoc.  The company cleared out all the mold they found and fumigated the house with a gas that kills mold spores making them no longer able to produce mold even if they land on a  food source.  With the mold gone, we decided to move back into our home.  That first night, my lymph glands swelled up again, and by the second day Rachel’s cough had come back with it’s signature chest tightness revealing the underlying beginnings of a nasty lung infection, as well as a flare up of the boy’s rash that had been going away while at my parents house.  After two days in the house we found out that we could no longer live there.  We didn’t know at the time that dead spores still carry mycotoxins, and that our house had 5 times the amount of spores inside than outside, but we knew we had to say good bye to our house and all of our stuff, never to live there again.  So, frustrated and defeated we returned back to my parents house not knowing how to fix the situation or even what to do with our house.  By this time we had racked up some hefty doctors bills, between my trips to the doctor, my CT scan, the family ER visit that resulted in nothing more then debt, and prescriptions that only treated symptoms.</p>
<p>Those few weeks of not knowing and not being able to understand even if I was told were the worst for us.  Rachel and I almost too sick to take care of our kids had to lean heavily on the help of my Aunt and Uncle while my parents were away on vacation, and then on them when they came back.  Our symptoms went away, and then returned in a wave like rhythm.  Over all we were getting better, but it was difficult to feel it.  We eventually found a doctor that knew what was going on with us and how to treat us.  Rachel didn’t have any insurance and my insurance wouldn’t cover the visits, so everything was out of pocket.  Between the prescriptions, a complete overhaul of our eating habits, rest, and new location, we got better.</p>
<p>A Month ago today, per our doctors advise after our inquiries, we moved out of my parents house into a tiny house built onto a triple axle trailer, and had it towed over the mountains to settle in an RV park in Bend, OR.  Not being able to afford another mortgage, we decided on the tiny house on a trailer which is classified as an RV.  We had always looked at simplifying our life and budget by selling the house and downsizing, considerably.  We felt we didn’t need as much space as we had, as well as being fed up with trying to keep a 2,000 sqft house clean with two destructive, playful boys.  After finding out that my work would let me work remotely, we decided to move.  We had looked into the tiny houses on trailers before, but didn’t think we wanted something that small.  In addition, they generally take 8 months to build, and we needed a place for us to live soon.  My parents hospitality would have seen us there happily for 8 months, but Rachel and I knew we needed to have a home, for us, for the boys, and for our health, and that it need to be in a dryer climate.  Despite my parents efforts, that often were extreme on the side of caution, we still seemed to have flare ups whenever it rained.  The valley in Oregon sees a lot of rain.  So our doctors advise was to move to Bend, OR, which sees sun 300 days a year, and when it does rain, the very dry air quickly absorbs it all.  We had settled on looking for an RV or Park Model, when I found a website of a company based out of Corvallis that builds these tiny houses, and was selling their display model on Craig’s List.  After seeing the display Model, we acquired an RV Loan and signed the papers to get them started on some internal modifications.  We had to make sure the house wouldn’t get mold, and if it did, we had to make sure we could fix it ourselves.  This was the number one reason I went with a house on a trailer and not an RV.  The one thing we didn’t know we were soon to find out.  Can we, a family of 4, live in a tiny, 144 sq. ft. house?</p>
<p>It has been a month now and we are feeling much better and loving our tiny house.  We get the boys out a lot during the day and use the house as a place to eat, sleep, and calm down.  Thanks to the weather we have been able to make it outside often and don’t have the flare up’s we where having living in the Willamette Valley.</p>
<p>This brings you all up to date.  Rachel’s symptoms are practically gone, and have been for 3 weeks now, Amadeu’s rash has left his cheeks and is only on one leg.  Isaacs cough is gone and he is starting to talk full sentences that make sense.   He still has the rash on his cheeks that he has had since his first exposure to mold.  His violent fits have become less violent, and he is showing reasoning skills during them.  My vertigo is now much better as well as my other symptoms, we have not reached it yet, but we are seeing the finish line in the distance.</p>
<p>Again thank you everyone for your continued support, prayers, and encouragement.  We will keep getting better until we are over this.  We know there is a purpose for what we are going through.  We will find out what it is and pursue it.  If you would like to pray for us, we’ll be working on the process of giving back our house to the bank or selling it to someone who understands what they are getting, fighting the ER bill that was borderline malpractice, trying to figure out what to do with the stuff that is in our house that can be salvaged but never used by us, and trying to find a reliable vehicle that is for sure mold free.</p>
<p>I can’t say thank you enough for caring, for reading our story here, and for giving to us through your support, gifts, and love.  We could never have made it here without that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>God Bless!<br />
Andi, Rachel, Isaac and Amadeu Ruda</p>
