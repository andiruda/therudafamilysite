<h2>Living out love</h2>
<p>
	I don't want to do it.  I don't feel like doing it.  These are typically flags pointing toward my need for doing it, especially in the area of sacrifice.  Can anyone relate to me?  I don't want to pour myself out, or even I CAN'T pour myself out when I have already emptied my reserves and I need the fumes to make it to bed.  This seems to continually be what God wants though.  He wants the exhausted, spent me.  What better vessel to fill up than one that is completely empty?  How much more refreshing will you be to others around you when you are given a fresh portion from God?

<p class="scripture">
	<strong>Isaiah 40:31</strong><br />
	"but they who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength;<br />
	they shall mount up with wings like eagles;<br />
	they shall run and not be weary;<br />
	they shall walk and not faint"
</p>
<p>
	It all hinges on our requests.  Fill us up Lord!  Are you spent and have nothing to give?  That is a lie if you have the Holy Spirit dwelling in you!  You will ALWAYS  have something to give.  Christ sustains.  It is the nature of God to endure.  You were created to bring Glory to his nature, he has created you with the capacity to be filled up, to endure.  
</p>
<p class="scripture">
	<strong>1 John 3:19-23</strong><br />
	"By this we shall know that we are of the truth and reassure our heart before him; for whenever our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and he knows everything. Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence before God; and whatever we ask we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do what pleases him. And this is his commandment, that we believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as he has commanded us"
</p>

	So I challenge you today.  If you feel spent and like you have given everything.  Ask for more.  Take 5 minutes of quiet to clear your mind, then start by being honest with God about where you are at, and ask for him to fill up the rest.
