<p>
	Radical Reality is a summer camp for inner city youth that is put on anualy at the YWAM Chico base by <a href="http://www.donniemooreministries.org/" target="_blank">Donnie Moore Ministries</a>.  For 2 Weeks we will have just under 500 junior high and highschool age youth on our 500 acre campus.  The youth will be presented with the gospel, some of the for the first time.  The camp has been held here for the last 30+ years, and each year many youth decide to give their lives to Christ.  We are really excited to be apart of the camp this year.

<p>
	Rachel will be helping out at the front desk while the camp is running, and Andi will be helping with tech and network related issues as we increase the load of connected users on our network 4 fold.  Please pray for us and the youth that are coming here.  A lot of them will be experiencing God and a culture of love for the first time.  Pray that their hearts will be open to receiving the word the the Holy Spirit will move on them.

	Thank you all for your prayers and generous giving that allow the Ruda Family to be apart of this special event here at YWAM Chico!
